              <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
              <p><em>
                The Angel Returns is a fan mod that is not associated with Team Salvato or Joey Drew Studios and is not an official Bendy and the Ink Machine product. It is designed to be played only after the official game has been completed. You can download Doki Doki Literature Club at: <a href=http://ddlc.moe>http://ddlc.moe</a>
              </em></p>
              <h2>Installation</h2>
              <p>
                The files in Doki Doki: The Angel Returns alter Doki Doki Literature Club. You must have an installation of DDLC, which can be downloaded for free from <a href=http://ddlc.moe>http://ddlc.moe</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                To install, copy all files from the included <tt>game</tt> folder into the <tt>game</tt> folder in your DDLC installation folder. Opening Doki Doki Literature Club will now load with all of the modified files.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are running DDLC on Steam, you can access the game files by right-clicking the game in your Library, then selecting <tt>Properties</tt>. In the <tt>Local Files</tt> tab, click the <tt>Browse local files...</tt> button. This will open a window with the game directory.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mac users can access the game directory by right-clicking on the DDLC application and selecting <tt>Show Package Contents</tt>. Then, the game directory can be found in <tt>Contents/Resources/autorun</tt>.
              </p>
              <p>
                To uninstall this mod, simply delete all added files in the <tt>game</tt> directory.
              </p>
              <h2>Basic Help</h2>
              <p>
                To advance through the game, <tt>left-click</tt> or press the <tt>space</tt> or <tt>enter</tt> keys. When at a menu,
                <tt>left-click</tt> to make a choice, or use the arrow keys to select a choice and <tt>enter</tt> to activate it.
              </p>
            
              <h3>Game Menu</h3>
              <p>
                When playing a game, press the <tt>escape</tt> key to enter the game menu. The game menu
                gives the following choices:
              </p>
            
              <dl>
                <dt>Return</dt>
                <dd>Returns to the game.</dd>
                <dt>Save Game</dt>
                <dd>Allows you to save a game by clicking on a save slot.</dd>
                <dt>Load Game</dt>
                <dd>Allows you to load a game by clicking on a save slot. Clicking on "Auto" accesses the automatic save slots.</dd>
                <dt>Preferences</dt>
                <dd>
                  Changes the game preferences (options/configuration):
                  <dl>
                    <dt>Display</dt>
                    <dd>Switches between fullscreen and windowed mode.</dd>
                    <dt>Text Speed</dt>
                    <dd>Controls the rate at which text displays. The further to the right this slider is, the faster the text
                      will display. All the way to the right causes text to be shown instantly.</dd>
                    <dt>Skip - Unseen Text</dt>
                    <dd>Chooses between skipping messages that have been already seen (in any play through the game), and
                      skipping all messages.</dd>
                    <dt>Skip - After Choices</dt>
                    <dd>Controls if skipping stops upon reaching a menu.</dd>
                    <dt>Auto-Forward Time</dt>
                    <dd>Controls automatic advance. The further to the left this slider is, the shorter the amount of time
                      before the game advances. All the way to the right means text will never auto-forward.</dd>
                    <dt>Music and Sound Volume</dt>
                    <dd>Controls the volume of the Music and Sound effect channels, respectively. The further to the
                      right these are, the louder the volume.</dd>

                <dt>Escape</dt>

              <h2>Loading and Deleting Save Data</h2>
              <p>
                Some mods may offer the option to load some or all of your data from a previous Doki Doki Literature Club playthrough. If so, that option will be presented on the first load of the game, after the initial content warning and disclaimer.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you do choose to load previous data, the original Doki Doki Literature Club save data will not be changed.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some cases, you may want to delete your save data to start the game completely over. To do this, delete the <tt>persistent</tt> file for this mod. Follow <a href="https://www.renpy.org/wiki/renpy/doc/FAQ#Where_does_Ren.27Py_store_my_save_games_and_persistent_data.3F">this link</a> to learn where this data is stored on your system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deleting save data for a mod will not alter or delete original save data from Doki Doki Literature Club.
              </p>
