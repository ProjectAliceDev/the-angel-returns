Demo 0.1.2 Beta 2 Notes
=====================

Thank you for trying out the beta version of The Angel Returns: Demo (Update 2)!
There's a lot of features and improvements we are working on, and we're excited
to show to a working version.

Please note that this is pre-release software and that things may change in future
versions. Press "Send Feedback" in the game menu or in the Quick Menu to file an
issue on GitHub (note: GitHub account required).

Changes since Beta 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* We've introduced a brand-new main menu! If you're a fan of Source games like Half-Life
  2 and Portal, you'll certainly enjoy this menu. The background for the menu changes at
  random times, and we've introduced a new theme.
* The kitchen fight scene in the second day has been completely rewritten, thanks to a few
  days of script writing!
* We've brought in the new AliceOS boot screen! Enjoy chibi Alice hopping around when you
  start the game.
* We've extended the Setup screens! It'll now let you know of the Send Feedback functionality
  presented in the game menu and the main menu. Also, we've brought along the infamous spinner
  (you'll know it when you see it).


Thanks a lot, and we can't wait to hear your feedback!
