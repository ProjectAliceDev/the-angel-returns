Demo 0.1.2 Beta Notes
=====================

Thank you for trying out the beta version of The Angel Returns: Demo (Update 2)!
There's a lot of features and improvements we are working on, and we're excited
to show to a working version.

Please note that this is pre-release software and that things may change in future
versions. Press "Send Feedback" in the game menu or in the Quick Menu to file an
issue on GitHub.

Changes since 0.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* We've introduced Mio as a character and hence have revamped the story to include her.
* The Mojave Setup Assistant will be replaced with AliceOS's setup screen, but we've
  added a new notification to indicate when the playername has been set already. Pressing
  "Respond" will give the player the ability to start a new game with that name rather
  than inputting a new one. Otherwise, the notification will dismiss itself and proceed
  as normal.
* AliceOS, or a beta version, anyway, is now included! There's new Applets, frameworks, and
  services to enhance gameplay for any DDLC mod or Ren'Py projects. This version of AliceOS
  is special enough where it includes new skins and applets only avaialble in The Angel 
  Returns.
* The puzzles now have windows and visual hints rather than cryptic dialogs. This should make
  solving the puzzles a bit easier and more engaging. This is in part with the new Applets
  functionality brought by AliceOS.
* We've overhauled the visual appearance of the mod to make it more in line with AliceOS and
  the elementaryOS project.
* We've updated the version to 0.1.2 and clearly display it in the corner of the main menu.

Thanks a lot, and we can't wait to hear your feedback!
