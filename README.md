[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheAngelReturns/the-angel-returns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TheAngelReturns/the-angel-returns)

It's spring break! Join the Literature Club girls in an exciting one-week adventure as they visit Angelhaus Productions, the successor to Joey Drew Studios! Solve fun minipuzzles and have a good time with the girls. Of course, don't forget about the Angel! You wouldn't want her to `[Just Alice.]`

*Doki Doki: The Angel Returns* is an unofficial mod for the game _Doki Doki Literature Club!_ that takes place after the events of the game (see [IP Guidelines](IPGuidelines.md) for details). This mod is the answer to a simple question: **What if "Alice Angel" came to the Doki Doki universe?**

> The Angel Returns is a fan mod that is not associated with Team Salvato or Joey Drew Studios and is not an official Bendy and the Ink Machine product.
