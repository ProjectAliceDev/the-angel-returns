[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ProjectAliceDev/the-angel-returns.svg?branch=nova-scotia)](https://travis-ci.org/ProjectAliceDev/the-angel-returns)

> This is the for the branch `ralsei`, dedicated to the developments of Project Nova and Project Scotia. To get started with quick development on Nova/Scotia, you can get started with [your own Gitpod workspace](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ProjectAliceDev/the-angel-returns/tree/nova-scotia) or [use an existing one](https://c53bfdb0-f2e1-45e2-bcb5-cfa29a105200.ws-us.gitpod.io/
) (hosted by Marquis Kurt).

It's spring break! Join the Literature Club girls in an exciting one-week adventure as they visit Angelhouse, the spiritual successor to Joey Drew Studios! Solve fun minipuzzles and have a good time with the girls. Just remember that `<DATA EXPUNGED>`.

**Doki Doki: The Angel Returns** is an unofficial mod for the game _Doki Doki Literature Club!_ that takes place after the events of the game and _Bendy and the Ink Machine_. This mod is the result of an experiment to bring a character from one game to another with a Character File Format converter (.chr) in hopes of answering the question: _What happens if Alice Angel enters the Dokiverse?_

> The Angel Returns is a fan mod that is not associated with Team Salvato or Joey Drew Studios and is not an official Bendy and the Ink Machine product. Please read our [guideline spec](https://theangelreturns.aliceos.app/policies.html) for more information. We recommend that you play _Doki Doki Literature Club!_ and _Bendy and the Ink Machine_ (up to Chapter 4) before playing The Angel Returns.
