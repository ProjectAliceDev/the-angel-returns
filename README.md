# Doki Doki: The Angel Returns
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheAngelReturns/the-angel-returns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TheAngelReturns/the-angel-returns)

It's spring break! Join the Literature Club girls in an exciting one-week adventure as they visit Angelhaus Productions, the successor to Joey Drew Studios! Solve fun minipuzzles and have a good time with the girls. Of course, don't forget about the Angel! You wouldn't want her to `[Just Alice.]`

**Doki Doki: The Angel Returns** is an unofficial mod for the game _Doki Doki Literature Club!_ that takes place after the events of the game and _Bendy and the Ink Machine_. This mod is the result of an experiment to bring a character from one game to another with a Character File Format converter (.chr) in hopes of answering the question: _What happens if Alice Angel enters the Dokiverse?_

> The Angel Returns is a fan mod that is not associated with Team Salvato or Joey Drew Studios and is not an official Bendy and the Ink Machine product. Please read the [IP Guidelines](IPGuidelines.md) for more information.
