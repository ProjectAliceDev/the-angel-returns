        "Hey [player],\n\nSo I wanted to tell you some things before we start out spring break trip tomorrow. I'm sorry if this isn't a good way to get to you; I don't have your number or anything, ehehe~\n\nPlease don't tell anyone this, but we've been keeping a watchful eye around the studio lately. We've had an intrusion problem for a while, and it's starting to worry a lot of us. I don't know if it's that Mio chick Monika keeps dismissively discussing about in CompSci, but I need your help in making sure the club stays safe. Monika's been through a lot with her lately, so I don't want to really burden her. I'm sure you understand. I'm pretty sure Mio won't be here anytime soon, but please let us know if you see her. She's kind of been pissing off my boss lately, and she isn't taking it lightly... (trust me, I've heard her endless rants the past few days, and it's really hurting my ears).\n\nI'm also going to make an assumption that we can keep these emails in confidence. Please, please, please... don't tell anyone else! The only other one who knows about these emails is my boss (she proofreads my stuff for me). I want to keep this under control as much as possible.\n\nAlso, I might've told my boss about you in particular so she, uh, might have some interest or sway. I don't know what your status is like, so feel free to dismiss some stuff from her at times. She can get a little excited at times. (She didn't proofread this, so I'm sorry if there's an error, ehehe~)\n\nThanks, [player]. I hope we can count on you. See you tomorrow~!\n\nSigned,\nSayonika <sayonika@maidcafe.me>"
