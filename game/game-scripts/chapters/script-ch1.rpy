    "I wake up feeling a bit refreshed from the events of yesterday."
    "Looking around, I realize that I forgot to turn off my computer last night."
    "What did Sayonika mean about an intruder?"
    "Well, if anything, we should be protected..."
    "I get my clothes on and trudge downstairs to the kitchen."

    "To my surprise, I find Monika prancing about in the kitchen."
    "I squint at the time on the microwave."
    "7:30 AM."
    "Wow, I woke up pretty early for a Saturday on my own..."
    "It takes a second before Monika notices me."

    mc "Good morning..."
    m "I was almost finished making eggs."
    m 3ck "I thought you would've woken up much later..."
    mc "Yeah, same here."
    mc "Did you find everything alright in there?"
    mc "I know my father's organization of the dishes isn't the most logical..."
    m 3cb "Ahaha, it's fine!"
    m 3cd "I was hoping I could make french toast, too."
    m "But, it doesn't look like you have any of the right ingredients."
    m 4cn "Or coffee, for that matter..."
    mc "Oh, ehehe~"
    mc "We don't keep the coffee in the kitchen."
    mc "We actually keep it in the pantry..."
    mc "Here, I'll get it for you."
    "I quickly open the pantry door and grab the coffee filter and canister."
    mc "Here, I hope you like French roast..."
    m "It's fine. Thanks!"
    "I quickly glance over and see the eggs cooking."
    mc "Um, actually..."
    mc "I'll take care of the coffee and what not. You should probably watch the eggs."

    m 1cd "Oh, shoot!"
    "We both rush into the kitchen."
    "As Monika observes the eggs, I quickly take a corner and start up the coffee machine."
    "At the same time, I start digging through the fridge for something sweet."
    "Sadly, I don't have anything like French toast..."
    "{i}Maybe{/i} mochi could work...?"
    "I pull out the container of the baked mochi from two nights ago and pull off the foil covering."
    "Monika doesn't seem to notice me as I pull out a knife and start cutting it."
    "Swiftly, I pull out the plates from underneath and plop two mochi slices on them."
    "I glance at the coffee pot and pull out two mugs."
    "Monika turns around to look for the plates and spots my plates on the counter."
    "She quizzically looks at the mochi and takes the plates anyway, shrugging."
    "She takes the eggs from the pan and places them gently on the plates while I start pouring the coffee into the mugs."
    "I slide right by Monika as she rushes to get the plates onto the coffee table in the living room."
    "I grab the powdered creamer and sugar, looking for a place to put them down."
    "Gracefully, I place them near the mugs."
    "Monika swings back in to grab silverware; I proceed to grab napkins."
    "When everything's settled, we synchronously sit down on the couch."

    "We slowly pick up our plates and silverware."
    m 1cb "You know, that was interesting how we stayed to each other's rhythms..."
    m 5ca "It felt magical."
    mc "Yeah, that is kind of interesting..."
    mc "Almost unexpected, even."
    m 4cl "And probably your choice of mochi?"
    mc "Oof."
    "I know it wasn't the best choice."
    "But it's sweet at least, right?"
    "I'm sure that's not a problem..."
    mc "Well, I assumed you wanted something sweet, so..."

    m 1cb "It's fine, it's fine..."
    "Monika gleefully takes a bite from the mochi."
    "Her eyes light up rapidly, glimmering in the sunlight."
    m 1ck "So good..."
    "She alternates between the egg and the mochi, constantly beaming in the process."
    "I take a sip of coffee."
    mc "So, when are we leaving?"
    m 3cd "Well, everyone's supposed to be down on campus by 10:00, so maybe 9:30?"
    mc "Alright. Sounds reasonable."
